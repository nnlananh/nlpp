# 📚 Document Paraphrase & Summarization Chatbot
## 📌 Introduction  
This chatbot is designed to help users **summarize** and **paraphrase** text efficiently. By leveraging **advanced NLP models**, it saves time when reading long documents and enhances content comprehension.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Provide an **interactive chatbot** for real-time text processing.  
- Support **document summarization** and **paraphrasing** using **AI models**.  
- Allow users to **upload documents** in **DOC, TXT, and PDF** formats.  
- Offer a **user-friendly interface** for smooth interactions.  

## 👥 Target Users  
- **Students**: To summarize lecture notes, study materials, and academic papers.  
- **Researchers**: To extract key points from long research papers and reports.  
- **General Users**: To quickly understand lengthy documents.  

## 🔍 Approach  
### 🧠 AI Models Used  
The chatbot utilizes **Hugging Face Transformers** for Natural Language Processing:  
- **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** → Used for paraphrasing and text generation.  
- **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer)** → Used for high-quality text summarization.  
- **GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** → Used for fluency and text generation improvements.  

## 🛠 Features  
✅ **Document Upload** → Supports **PDF, DOC, and TXT** file processing.  
✅ **Interactive Chatbot** → Provides **real-time summarization & paraphrasing**.  
✅ **Multiple AI Models** → Users can choose different NLP models.  
✅ **User-Friendly UI** → Clean and simple interface for easy interaction.  

## 🏗 Requirement 
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python **3.7+**  
- Flask (for web app)  
- Transformers (Hugging Face library)  
- Other dependencies (see `requirements.txt`) 

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Upload a document** (PDF, DOC, or TXT).
2. **Choose a model**:
   - Summarization
   - Paraphrasing
3. **Click "Send"** to process and receive the result.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python (Flask)** – Backend framework
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – NLP models
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend UI

## 📌 Future Improvements
-  **Multilingual Support** → Allow summarization in different languages.
-  **More AI Models** → Add support for GPT-4 and other transformers.
-  **Better File Processing** → Improve handling of large PDF and DOCX files.
